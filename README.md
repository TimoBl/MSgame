#Â MS Lesion Game

This is just a fun little game to identify new multiple sclerosis lesions on an MRI.
You need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and then it can be run with `node index.js`. Head over to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) to see the game. 
If the screen appears weird just refresh the page, this will readapt screen size to fit the page.
